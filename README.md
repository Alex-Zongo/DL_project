 project for Deep Learning Class

    For Training:
        First run the main.py file to download the dataset
        Then:
            1. Run train.py to train and test on the wave-unet model
            2. Run train_model_hq.py to train and test the modified version of wave-unet on the MusDB18-HQ after you downloaded the full dataset
            3. Run train_demucs.py to train and test on the modified version of Demucs. # performance does not exceed the modified wave-unet
